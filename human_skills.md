    - 15% of the time used on breaks
    - 30% of the time used on involvement of the participant
    - 50% of the time used on knowledge presentation to the participant
- Have the full control of the meeting by delegating responsibilities:
    - Fix technical problems, e.g. Audio/Video
    - Assign a chat responsible (for online meetings)
