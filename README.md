# How to do data science
A collection of tips and tricks to conduct good data science. I have colected these tips and tricks since I started as a data scientist in 2017. The documentation is mainly for my own purpose, but hopefully it can help other data scientist to learn from my findings and mistakes.

Note that I use the [GitHib integration](https://app.diagrams.net/?mode=github) diagrams.net - formerly known as draw.io. See also https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-github
